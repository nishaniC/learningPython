# here are our goals:
#
# we want to write a program which reads the address of a WWW site (e.g., pythoninstitute.org) using the standard input() function and fetches the root document
# (the main HTML document of the WWW site) of the specified site;
# the program outputs the document to the screen;
# the program uses TCP to connect to the HTTP server.

# create a new socket able to handle connection-oriented transmissions based on TCP;
# connect the socket to the HTTP server of a given address;
# send a request to the server (the server wants to know what we want from it)
# receive the server's response (it will contain the requested root document of the site)
# close the socket (end the connection)

# The socket module contains all the tools we need to deal with sockets.
import socket
server_addr = input("What server do you want to connect to? ")
# it can be the domain name of the server (like www.pythoninstitute.org, but without the leading http://)
# it can be the IP address of the server (like 87.98.235.184), but it must be said firmly that this variant is potentially ambiguous.
# Why? Because there can be more than one HTTP server located at the same IP address - the server you will reach may be not the server you intended to connect to.

#first argument specify the Internet socket domain; as different domains require completely different socket countenance, the target domain has to be known at the moment;
# the second argument is a socket type code (we may use the SOCK_STREAM symbol here to specify a high-level socket able to act as a character device -
# a device that can handle single characters,# as we are interested in transferring data byte by byte, not as fixed sized blocks
# (e.g., a terminal is a character device, while a disk isn't)
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
# the sock socket  is prepared to work on top of TCP protocol - it has the default socket configuration.

# You may ask - why 80? Can I put something else instead of this? No, you canâ€™t. 80 is a well-known service number for HTTP.
# Any Internet browser will try to connect to port number 80 by default, so we do it, too.
# If something goes wrong, the connect() method (and any other method whose results may be unsuccessful) raises an exception(socket.gaierror( this means get address info error),
# ConnectionRefusedError ,socket.timeout).
sock.connect((server_addr, 80))

# A conversation with the HTTP server consists of requests (sent by the client) and responses (sent by the server).
# HTTP defines a set of acceptable requests - these are the request methods or HTTP words. The method asking the server to send a particular document of a given name is called GET
# To get a root document from a site named www.site.com the client should send the request containing a correctly formed GET method description:
# GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
# Host: www.site.com\r\n
# Connection: close\r\n
# \r\n
# The GET method requires:
# a line containing the method name (i.e., GET) followed by the name of the resource the client wants to receive; the root document is specified as a single slash (i.e., /); the line must also include the HTTP protocol version (i.e., HTTP/1.1) and must end with the characters \r\n; note: all lines must end the same way;
# a line containing the name of the site (e.g., www.site.com) preceded by the parameter name (i.e., Host:)
# a line containing a parameter named Connection: along with its value close, which forces the server to close the connection after the first request is served; it will simplify our client's code;
# an empty line is a request terminator.

# The send() method doesn't natively accept strings - this is why we have to use the b prefix before the literal parts of the request string
# (it silently translates the string into bytes - an immutable vector consisting of values from the range 0..255, which send() likes most) and this is also why we should
# invoke bytes() to translate the string variable in the same manner.
#
# Note: the bytes' second argument specifies the encoding used to store the server's name. UTF8 seems to be the best choice for most modern OSs.
#
# The action performed by the send() method is extremely complicated - it engages not only many layers of the OS, but also lots of network equipment deployed
# on the route between the client and server, and obviously the server itself.

# The recv() method waits for the server's response, gets it, and puts it inside a newly created object of type bytes
# The argument specifies the maximal acceptable length of the data to be received. If the server's response is longer than this limit, it will remain unreceived.
# You will need to invoke recv() again (maybe more than once) to get the remaining part of the data. It's a general practice to invoke recv() as long as it returns some data.
reply = sock.recv(10000)

# Invoking shutdown() is like a message whispered directly into the server's ear: "We have no more to say to you. We don't want to hear from you, either. The rest is silence."
# The following function arguments say more about our views for the future:
# socket.SHUT_RD - we aren't going to read the server's messages anymore (we declare ourselves deaf)
# socket.SHUT_WR - we won't say a word (actually, we'll be dumb)
# socket.SHUT_RDWR - specifies the conjunction of the two previous options.
sock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)

sock.close()

# we'll just print it out using the built-in repr() function, which takes care of the clear (almost) textual presentation of any object
print(repr(reply))
